# Health-Informatics-Projects

This repository includes course projects completed by Olina (Qiuyu) Zhu at Yale University School of Public Health, M.S. Health Informatics program. Some course-specific requirement/instruction statements were removed to improve readability of scripts. Note completion of scripts were based on instruction and some code snipets from CPSC577 Natural Language Processing Teaching Fellows Linyong Nan and Malcolm Sailor. 

Code prior to 2022 are not present, as they were saved on school servers and are no longer accessible.
